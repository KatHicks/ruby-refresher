# Ruby Refresher
### Makers Academy Weekend Challenge No. 7

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KatHicks/ruby-refresher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KatHicks/ruby-refresher) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/KatHicks/ruby-refresher/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/KatHicks/ruby-refresher?branch=master)

### Instructions

* We were given the weekend to complete the challenge and were not allowed to use any gems to solve the challenges.
* As usual, we were required to work on our own for this challenge
* We were allowed, again as usual, to consult resources online or in books

### Task

We have 41 empty methods with failing tests. The task is to implement code within the empty methods to make the tests pass. You should be able to do at least 50% of them and they vary in level from quite easy to fairly hard. Work through them and check if they're correct by running the specs.

You should be able to answer most questions with a couple of lines of code, and just a few methods. If you're writing a long, complex solution, there's probably a better way.

See here for the full instructions: [INSTRUCTIONS.md](ruby-refresher/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Using my application

* To run the specs, just run `$ rspec questions_spec.rb` or `$ rspec` only
* All my individual methods and solutions are in the `questions.rb` file ([see here](ruby-refresher/lib/questions.rb))

### Dependencies

* Used **RSpec** for testing and plain **Ruby** to pass the tests
* No other gems were used as part of the task was the solve the problems independently without the help of external libraries

### Reflections on my solutions

* **Lots of fun**
  * ...
* **Cleaning up results arrays**
  * ...
* **Using the tests to explain the task**
